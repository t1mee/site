              This device helps to manage servers or workstations remotely, regardless of the health of the
              operating system or whether one is installed.
              You can fix any problem, configure the BIOS, or even reinstall the OS using the included
              CD-ROM or Flash Drive emulation.
              <br><br>
              <b>It only costs between $30 and $100</b> depending on the features desired.
              Even the most expensive configuration will be cheaper than a $500 commercial IP-KVM.

        <h2>Fully-featured and modern IP-KVM</h2>
        <div class="text-left">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Easy to build</b><br>A ready-to-use OS that can be created just by running <i>make build</i> and installed to an SD-card
              using <i>make install</i>. The hardware can be made in half an hour and without soldering.
            </li>
            <li><b>Very low video latency</b><br>~100 milliseconds of video latency. This is the smallest delay of all existing solutions.
            </li>
            <li><b>Extra lightweight Web UI and VNC</b><br>
              No weird proprietary clients. No ugly applets. Just use your favorite browser to connect to the Pi-KVM.
              No flash plugins either! Ah, and VNC is also supported.
            </li>
            <li><b>Keyboard &amp; mouse</b><br>Mouse usage works directly in the browser. The keyboard emulator supports displaying the state of the keyboard LEDs.
            </li>
            <li><b>Mass Storage Drive</b><br>
              On the Raspberry Pi 4 and ZeroW, Pi-KVM can emulate a virtual CD-ROM or Flash Drive.
              A live image can be uploaded to boot the attached server.
            </li>
            <li><b>ATX power management</b><br>
              With a very simple circuit that can be assembled on a breadboard, the power button of the attached server
              can be controlled using the ATX button headers on the motherboard.
            </li>
            <li><b>Security</b><br>
              Pi-KVM can be opened to the Internet and no one will get access without the authorization.
              SSL encryption is used to protect traffic from being intercepted by third parties.
            </li>
            <li><b>Local monitoring</b><br>
              Pi-KVM monitors the health of the Raspberry Pi board and will warn you if it's too hot
              or is not receiving enough power.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h2>Production-ready</h2>
        <div class="text-left">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Linux-based embedded OS</b><br>
              The Pi-KVM OS is based on  
              <a href="https://archlinuxarm.org" target="_blank">Arch Linux ARM</a>  
              and can be customized for any needs. Thousands of pre-built binary packages are at your service
              and can be updated with a single command!
            </li>
            <li><b>Read-only filesystem</b><br>
              By default the OS runs in read-only mode, as an embedded system should. This prevents damage
              to the memory card due to a sudden power outage.
            </li>
            <li><b>VNC server</b><br>The managed server and its BIOS can be accessed using a regular VNC client which supports JPEG compression.
            </li>
            <li><b>IPMI BMC</b><br>Use <i>ipmitool</i>, <i>ipmiutil</i> or any existing network infrastructure that supports IPMI
              to monitor and manage the server's power.
            </li>
            <li><b>Wake-on-LAN</b><br>Pi-KVM can be configured to power up a managed server using WoL. This will be available in the Web menu.
            </li>
            <li><b>Extensible authorization methods</b><br>
              Multiple Pi-KVMs can be configured to use a common authorization service.
              PAM and its rich authorization mechanisms can also be used to integrate Pi-KVM into your existing
              authentication infrastructure.
            </li>
            <li><b>Macro scripts</b><br>
              If repetitive actions must be perfromed on the attached server (or on several different servers),
              a macro can be recorded with keyboard & mouse actions and can be played back mutiple times.
            </li>
          </ul>

               written in C with multi-threading support and GPU video encoding - the fastest streaming solution available
              to provide the best video quality for Pi-KVM. We also tested a lot of hardware configurations
               so that you can be sure devices you assemble will work reliably.
